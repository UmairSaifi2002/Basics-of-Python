# What will be the output of the following code block?

a=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
print(a[::2])

'''
In the given code block, a slice operation is performed on the list a. 
The slice operation uses the syntax a[start:stop:step]. 
In this case, start is not specified (defaults to 0), stop is not specified (defaults to the end of the list), and the step is 2. 
The slice operation creates a new list containing elements from the original list, 
starting at the beginning, going until the end, and selecting every second element (using a step of 2).

So, the output of the code block will be:

[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]

The slice operation picks the elements at indices 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 from the original list.
