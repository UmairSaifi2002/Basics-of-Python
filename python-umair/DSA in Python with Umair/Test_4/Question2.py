# What will be the output of the following code block?

a=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
a[::2]=10,20,30,40,50,60
print(a)

'''
Overall explanation
The code block you provided contains a syntax error. The slice assignment a[::2] = 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 
should have the same number of elements on both sides, but it doesn't. The slice a[::2] selects every second element of the list a, 
which results in a list of 5 elements: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]. On the right side of the assignment, 
there are 6 elements: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60. Since the number of elements is not equal, Python will raise a ValueError when executing this code:

ValueError: attempt to assign sequence of size 6 to extended slice of size 5

To fix the error, you should ensure that the number of elements on both sides of the assignment is the same. 
For example, you can change the right side of the assignment to have only 5 elements:

a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
a[::2] = 10, 20, 30, 40, 50
print(a)
The output of the corrected code block will be:

[10, 2, 20, 4, 30, 6, 40, 8, 50]
